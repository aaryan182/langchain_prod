Evaluation and Regression Testing for LLM Systems

What usually happens in LLM teams: prompt is changed, Looks better in  manual testing, shipped to prod, silent Regression, trust is lost, nobody knows why

Traditional unit tests do not work for LLMs. But no tests is unacceptable


Why Langchain is used for Evaluation?
Raw SDK testing: Hard to standardize, no schema enforcement, no reusable evaluators, no scoring discipline

Langchain gives: structured eval chains, reusable evaluators, deterministic harnesses, clean separation of concerns



We cannot test correctness, we must test consistency.

LLM evaluation focuses on: 
Did system abstain when it should? Did the answer remain grounded? Did confidence drop for weak evidence? Did behavior change across versions?



This Enables in Production

With this harness, we can:
Test prompt changes before merging
Compare model versions
Catch hallucination regressions
Enforce abstention policies
Track quality over time
This is CI for LLM systems.
