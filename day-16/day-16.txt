ReAct, Tool Agents and Controlled Autonomy

Learning when agents are justified, how to build them safely and how to constrain autonomy so they don't turn into unreliable decisions.

If we misuse agents we will: increase latency, increase cost, reduce determinism, make systems impossible to debug

Chains break down when: 
the number of steps is unknown upfront, decisions depend on intermediate results, the system must choose which tool to call next

Example real task: customer support troubleshooting, multi step research, incident investigation, knowledge discovery across tools

Trying to do this with fixed DAGs leads to: huge if else logic, explosion of chains, unmaintainable code


=> Why Agents Exist: 
Chains: Deterministic, Fixed Structure, Predictable, Cheap, Easy to debug

Agents: Dynamic, self directed, tool selecting, expensive, harder to reason about

Agents are for exploration not pipelines

If we can predefine steps => use chains
If steps are unknown => consider agents

=> The ReAct Pattern 
ReAct = Reason + Act

Thought -> Action -> Observation -> Thought -> ...

The LLM reasons in text, 
but the system executes tools.



Production Architecture for Agents: 

User Goal
   ↓
Agent (reasoning loop)
   ↓
Tool Selection (schema validated)
   ↓
Tool Execution (trusted)
   ↓
Observation
   ↓
Repeat or Finish


Important:

Max iterations
Tool allow list
Explicit stop condition
