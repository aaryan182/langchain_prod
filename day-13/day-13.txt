Production RAG with confidence scoring & abstention

Building a RAG system that: computes confidence scores, abstains when evidence is weak, avoids confident hallucinations, produces auditable answers

Classic RAG failure:
System answers confidently, answer is not supported by documents, users lose trust permanently

Raw SDK RAG: no structured scoring, no confidence calibration, no abstention mechanism, hard to enforce policies

Langchain lets us: add scoring chains, enforce schemas, build decision gates, keep logic composable

RAG answerablity has 3 dimensions: 
retrieval strength - are documents relevant?
coverage - do docs contain the answer?
answer grounding - is output supported?

Confidence Gate
   ├── Confident → Answer + score
   └── Low confidence → Abstain

We don’t just retrieve and answer. We score evidence strength and enforce abstention when confidence is low. This prevents hallucinations and builds user trust.
