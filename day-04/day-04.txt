Structured Outputs with Pydantic

In production , LLM output is often used to: write to databases, trigger workflows, call tools, generate reports, drive decisions

If our output is free-from text we will see:
crashes due to missing fields, silent corruption, partial JSON, Looks correct but breaks downstream 

Raw JSON prompting like this: "return JSON with fields X, Y, Z"
does not work reliably


Langchain gives us: Schema driven parsing, automatic format instructions, retry on parse failure loops, clear separation of concerns


LLM output != Data
LLM output + schema + validation = Data

Our system should assume: the model will violate the schema, will hallucinate fields, will break formatting 

=> Production Architecture Pattern
User Input
    ↓
PromptTemplate (with schema instructions)
    ↓
LLM
    ↓
Output Parser (Pydantic)
    ↓
Validated Object
    ↓
Downstream Systems (DB, tools, APIs)


If parsing fails:

Retry
Repair
Or fail loudly

Why do you use Pydantic output parsers?
LLMs don’t respect contracts. Pydantic lets us enforce schemas, validate outputs, retry on failure and prevent silent data corruption in downstream systems.
