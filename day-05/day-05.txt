Error Handling, Retries & Fallbacks

In real systems, LLM calls fails due to : Rate limits, Timeouts, Partial responses, schema violations, provider outages, latency spikes

If we don't handle these: APIs go down, Jobs get stuck, data pipelines corrupt state, customers lose trust

Failure is not an edge case.Failure is the default state at scale.


=> Raw SDK calls gives us: one attempt, one model, one failure path
Langchain give us: retry policies, fallback chains, failure isolation


=> Treat LLM calls like: network requests, external microservices, unreliable depedencies 
We must design for : retries, timeouts, fallbacks, partial degradation

=> Production Failure Handling Architecture
Input
  ↓
Primary Chain
  ↓ (failure)
Retry Logic
  ↓ (still fails)
Fallback Chain (cheaper or safer model)
  ↓
Controlled Failure / Safe Output


Key rule:
Failure must be explicit, observable and contained.
